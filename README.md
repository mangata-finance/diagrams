alt DEPOSIT token from L1 to L2

    user --> gaspcontract: Approval of 1 WETH token usage
    user --> gaspcontract: Trigger deposit of 1 WETH token 

else WITHDRAWAL from L2 to L1

    user --> collator: Initialize withdrawal
    collator --> collator: Withdrawal validations (balance,token existence,...)
    collator --> collator: Burn token for user

end

note over sequencer
  There is round robin selection of sequencers and selected sequencer is supposed to bring ETH information (deposit) to Gasp Node.
end note

sequencer --> collator: Checks weather its my round to submit "read" from L1 to L2.

sequencer --> gaspcontract: Fetch PENDING_REQUESTS (reads)

note over sequencer
Sequencer monitoring system. Sequencer runs a job that tracks the updates and submits cancel requests if something observed. 
Not related to selection of the sequencer to provide L1 "read". It's async job. Each Sequenbcer have NUM_OF_SEQUENCER - 1 cancel rights.
end note

 loop for each PENDING_REQUESTS read
 
 sequencer --> gaspcontract: get pending reads based on lastProccessedRequestOnL1 and lastAcceptedRequestOnL1
 
 sequencer --> sequencer: compare PENDING_REQUESTS read and pending read from ETH contract. Using hashing, or byte array value.

    alt PENDING_REQUESTS read is NOT same as on ETH contract
      sequencer --> collator: Submit Cancel request extrinsic
    else if the values match
        note over sequencer
          We dont need to do any action.
        end note

note over sequencer
Sequencer have 1 READ right that allows him to provide the information from L1.
end note
sequencer --> gaspcontract: Read all ETH dep/with based on sequencer_latest_processed_block sequencer_latest_processed_transaction_id
sequencer --> collator: Submit provide_l1_read extr. with all fetched ETH dep/with

collator --> collator: store new value into pending_l1_reads with dispute period (block number)

group Separate action on Collator (maybe will move to separate UML)

  loop for each block at end_dispute_period
  
    loop for each l1_read
    
    
        collator --> collator: Validates if Sequencer have enough Stake to submit
        collator --> collator: Removes the READ right from sequencer (node storage update)
    
      alt l1_read is DEPOSIT
          collator --> collator: Deposits validations (balance,...)

          end
          alt ETH Asset registry DOES exists
            collator --> collator: Fetch Gasp version of ERC20 token
          else ETH address does NOT exists
            collator --> collator: Register new asset registry and use it
          end
        collator --> collator: Mint token for user
      
      else l1_read is CANCEL_RESOLUTION
        note over collator
          This action is triggered from Gasp contract when cancelation is resolved. It will be resolved by comparing the reads.
        end note
        alt CANCEL_RESOLUTION is CANCEL_APPROVED
          collator --> collator: Find malicious l1_read in history with Sequencer address
          collator --> collator: Call slash_sequencer(seq_address)

          collator --> collator: Find malicious cancel request in history with Sequencer address
          collator --> collator: Call slash_sequencer(seq_address)
        end
        
      end
    
      note over collator
        Our merkle leafs (pending updates) should be unique
      end note
   
      collator --> collator: Store succesfull WITHDRAWAL and CANCELS to pending_updates (leafs of Merkle root) 
        
      alt automatically when update_batch_size is reached
         collator --> collator: Prepare batch for updater to update
      else automatically timed when update_minimal_block_period is reached 
         collator --> collator: Prepare batch for updater to update
      else optional creation
        note over collator
            There needs to be extrinsic to form a new batch. There is a configurable merkle_root_batch_creation_fee for this tx. This fee needs to be higher than Eigen layer estimated costs.
        end note
      end
      
    collator --> collator: Returns back the READ right for sequencer (node storage update)
    
    end
    
  
  end
end

agregator --> archive: Check if there is a new batch of updates formed on the Node
agregator --> eigencontract: Submits task: "Finalize GASP blocks"
operator --> eigencontract: Fetches the new task
note over follower
  Merkle Root should be build on demand inside RPC, when asked.
end note
operator --> follower: Reads pending_updates hashes and Merkel Root of pending_updates
operator --> operator: Validates N blocks and do storage proof - N should be configurable
operator --> operator: Prepare the Merkel Root of pending_updates as task response
operator --> operator: Sign the response with operator PK
operator --> agregator: Returns finished task
alt when quorum is met
    agregator --> eigencontract: Submits TX with Merkel Root information
else quorum is not met
    note over agregator
        Mark previous task as failed and forma  new one again. Max retries 3. Manual council intervention needed afterwards.
    end note
    agregator --> eigencontract: Retry task
end
eigencontract --> eigencontract: Stores Merkel Root information with batch identifier

updater --> eigencontract: Subscribed for for the finilized updates
updater --> eigencontract: Fetch the eygen layer Merkel Root

note over updater
    Information submited from updater needs to be signed by Eigen Layer operators.
     Rolldown contract needs to verify this against its stored list of operators aggregated key and stakes.
     This list synchronisation is described in different diagram.
end note

updater --> gaspcontract: Executes TX to submit Merkle Root with pending_update batch identifier.

gaspcontract --> gaspcontract: Stores Merkel Root with pending_update batch identifier

user --> archive: Get the pending update and proof from RPC.
user --> gaspcontract: Close withdrawal (bringing pending_update + signed proof from Eigen layer)
gaspcontract --> gaspcontract: Validate the proofs
note over gaspcontract
  Fee is payed by user
end note
gaspcontract --> user: Sends funds to user address
